This is a car controller prototype, made with Unity and. All the code and 3D models are 100% made by me. It is designed to be played with a controller, not with a keyboard.

### Features

-   Physics based movement!
-   Master the drifting mechanics through the curves.

-   Customize your car.

### Extra tips

-   If your car rolls over, you can flip it back by braking or accelerating.
-   Press *Q* to look back, and *Q* to honk.
-   You can navigate all the menus with just a keyboard or a controller, you don't need a mouse!
-   Press *ESC *to open the menu, and restart the game or go back to customize your car.
-   The *soft *suspension can help you navigate through the hills :)

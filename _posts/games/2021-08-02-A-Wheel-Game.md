You are a wheel, try to complete the levels as fast as you can!

I made this game to test Unity physics, mobile game controles, and JSON save format.

In terms of accesibility, the game has high contrast colors, you can customize your touchscreen controlls, play with a keyboard, or with a controller. And the game has no text, so everything is indicated with just icons.

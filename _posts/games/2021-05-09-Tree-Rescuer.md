This game was made for the [Make A Level Jam](https://itch.io/jam/make-a-level-may), the theme was *emergency*, so I made a game where you have to save trees from diferent emergencies:

* Fire: Use a fire extinguisher to stop it.
* Dryness: Avoid it with a watering can.
* Bees: use a spray to kick them out.

## Controls

* Move: WASD, or arrow keys.
* Use object: Mouse click, E, or M
* Drop / swap object: Right mouse click, Q, or N

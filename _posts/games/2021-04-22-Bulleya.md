A different bullet hell game every 10 seconds.\
Inspired by [Pureya](https://majorariatto.itch.io/pureya).

This game was made in only 10 hours, using Unity, and Inkscape made for the [Bullet Hell Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/bullet-jam-2021). But later improved by adding some polish, new sounds, and a new minigame.

**Press E** to swipe between dimensions**.**

## Dimension Swapper

This game was made for my first gamejam! The [Nokia Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam3). The theme was ON / OFF, so i made this game where you swipe between two dimensions to turn platforms on and off.

Its a very simple and short game, but it's made with tons of love, and I hope you enjoy it and have fun :D

I made it with Unity 2019.4.17, and the assets were made using Gimp.
